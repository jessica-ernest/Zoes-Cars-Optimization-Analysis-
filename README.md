# Zoes-Cars-Optimization-Analysis-

## Project Overview
Zoe Cars, a successful automotive company, is struggling to manage its surging sales data and optimize inventory levels. They need insightful data analysis to make informed decisions, so they're using SQL queries to better understand their sales data, anticipate demand trends, and streamline their business processes.
